# 🌟 Medical-Insurance-Insights-and-Prediction 🌟


Medical insurance has become a necessity for many individuals due to rising healthcare costs. Accurately estimating medical expenses is a challenging task due to the diverse health conditions of individuals. However, some conditions, such as lung cancer in smokers or heart disease in obese individuals, are more prevalent in specific population segments.

Insurance companies spend significant time and resources developing models to forecast medical expenses accurately. This project aims to leverage data science methodologies to create a predictive model that can estimate medical costs based on the predictors provided in the dataset.
